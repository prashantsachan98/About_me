    <string name="bio">Hi, this is Prashant.
    \nI\m tired of being what you want me to be
\nFeeling so faithless, lost under the surface
\nDont know what you are expecting of me
\nPut under the pressure of walking in your shoes
\n(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you
\n(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
\n\nI have become so numb, I can\'t feel you there
\nBecome so tired, so much more aware
\nI am becoming this, all I want to do
\nIs be more like me and be less like you
\n\ncan\'t you see that you\'re smothering me?
\nHolding too tightly, afraid to lose control
\n Cause everything that you thought I would be
\nHas fallen apart right in front of you
\n(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you\n\n</string>
